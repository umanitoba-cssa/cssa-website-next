# What courses do I need?

If you've done your homework (like reviewing the [First Year Planning Guide](https://umanitoba.ca/current-students/first-year/planning#first-year-planning-guide)), you'll know that course selection directly impacts your ability to progress in Computer Science. Here's the key thing: **every new student starts as "Undeclared"** in either University 1 or the Faculty of Science. Second-year COMP courses are restricted to students who've officially declared their program. Your top priority in first year? Meeting the requirements to declare a Computer Science major *before registration opens next July*.

## Declaring Your Program: The Essentials
- **Credit Requirement**: Complete **24 credit hours** (typically 8 courses)  
- **GPA Baseline**: Maintain at least a **2.5 DGPA** (C+ average), though competitive programs require higher  
- **Deadline**: Declare via Aurora or contact [Science Academic Advising](https://umanitoba.ca/science/student-experience/academic-advising) **before July** when Fall/Winter registration starts  
- **Flexibility**: You can switch programs later if you meet different requirements  

### Program-Specific Requirements (2025-2026)
Review these *minimums* carefully in the [Academic Calendar](https://umanitoba.ca/calendar) and confirm with an advisor:

| Program                                  | Min. DGPA | COMP 1020 | MATH 1700 | MATH 1300 | MATH 1240 | Other Requirements         |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------------------- |
| **B.Sc. Honours (CS)**                   | 3.00      | B (3.0)   | C (2.0)   | C+ (2.5)  | B (3.0)   | MATH 1210 (B) accepted for MATH 1300 |
| **B.Sc. Major (CS)**                     | 2.50      | C+ (2.5)  | C (2.0)   | C+ (2.5)  | C+ (2.5)  | MATH 1210 (B) accepted for MATH 1300 |
| **B.Sc. Joint Honours (CS/Mathematics)** | 3.00      | B (3.0)   | A (4.0)   | —         | —         | MATH 1232 (B) accepted for MATH 1700 |
| **B.Sc. Joint Honours (CS/Physics)**     | 3.00      | B (3.0)   | C (2.0)   | C+ (2.5)  | —         | PHYS 1070 (B) or PHYS 1030 (B+) |
| **B.Sc. Joint Honours (CS/Statistics)**  | 3.00      | B (3.0)   | —         | —         | —         | STAT 2150 (B)              |
| **B.Sc. Major (Data Science)**           | 2.00      | C+ (2.5)  | B (3.0)   | —         | —         | STAT 1150 (C+) or STAT 2220 (C+) or STAT 2000 (B)<br>MATH 1232 (C+) accepted for MATH 1700 |

> **Key Notes**:  
> - Unless explicitly mentioned, "harder" courses (MATH 1232 for MATH 1700, MATH 1220 for MATH 1300) *always* satisfy the requirements for their alternative, if the same grade threshold is met.
> - "B" = minimum 3.0 GPA in that course, "C+" = 2.5 GPA, etc.

## First-Year Course Roadmap (For CS Majors/Honours)
**Prioritize these 6 courses** to unlock program declaration and second-year COMP courses:

1. **COMP 1010** (Intro to Computer Science 1) *or COMP 1012*
   → Leads to: COMP 1020  
2. **COMP 1020** (Intro to Computer Science 2)  
   *Requires COMP 1010/1012*  
3. **MATH 1500** (Intro to Calculus) *or MATH 1230/1510*  
   → Leads to: MATH 1700  
4. **MATH 1700** (Calculus 2) *or MATH 1232/1710*  
   *Requires MATH 1500/1230/1510*  
5. **MATH 1300** (Linear Algebra) *or MATH 1220/1210*  
6. **MATH 1240** (Discrete Mathematics)  
   ⚠️ **Heads-up**: Often the toughest first-year course; offered Summer (May-June) as a standalone option  

### Critical Additions for Your 24 Credits
- **STAT 1150** (Intro to Stats & Computing):  
  **→ Required for COMP 2400 (Programming Paradigms), a core course in second year**. *Don't substitute unless absolutely necessary* – STAT 1000+2000 won't satisfy some upper-year prerequisites.  
- **1 Written Arts Course**:  
  ARTS 1110 is popular, but choose any that interests you.  
- **COMP Electives**:  
  Consider COMP 1000, COMP 1002, COMP 1006, COMP 1500, or COMP 1600.

## Pro Tips
- **STAT 1150 First**: With the new addition, this is as important as any other course if you want to be on schedule for second year. Delaying this blocks COMP 2400 and creates second-year bottlenecks. Take it anytime in Fall, Winter or even Summer. 
- **GPA > Speed**: Taking 4 courses/semester with strong grades beats overloading and risking poor marks. You *need* specific grades to declare.  
- **Summer Strategy**: MATH 1240 is more manageable as a solo Summer course. Use this to recover if needed.
- **Transfer Credits**: AP/IB credits for MATH 1500/1700? Replace them with STAT 1150 or COMP electives *early*.  
- **Full-Time Status**: Maintain ≥9 credits/term for scholarships, loans, and residency requirements.
- **Backup Plans**: Joint CS - Maths, ironically, has no MATH 1300 or MATH 1240 requirements. You just need to declare *a* program to unlock second year COMP courses (note that Data Science, as not an official CS program, doesn't unlock 2280). If you find yourself unable to meet some requirements but are able to meet others, declare first, register for courses, make up later!

**Always verify** course sequences using the [Academic Calendar](https://umanitoba.ca/calendar) and consult advisors when registering. Your path is unique – design it wisely!
