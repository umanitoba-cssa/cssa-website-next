# What degree should I do?

Choosing your specific program path in Computer Science can feel overwhelming, but it‚Äôs important to remember: **all these degrees unlock exciting careers in tech**. Your choice should reflect your academic strengths, interests, and long-term goals‚Äînot perceived prestige. Below is a breakdown of your options:

## üéì Honours vs. Major: What‚Äôs the Difference?
- **Honours Programs** (B.C.Sc. or B.Sc. Honours):  
  Require a **minimum 3.00 DGPA** to enter and graduate. They involve more advanced courses, often include a research component, and are designed for students pursuing graduate studies (e.g., MSc or PhD). They‚Äôre *essential* if you‚Äôre considering academia or research-intensive roles.  
- **Major Programs** (B.Sc. Major):  
  Require a **minimum 2.00‚Äì2.50 DGPA**. They offer greater flexibility for electives, minors, or co-op, and are ideal if you plan to enter industry directly after your degree. For most tech jobs, employers prioritize skills and experience over the "Honours" designation.  

### Key Takeaway:  
Outside of grad school applications, Honours and Major degrees hold similar weight in industry. Your internships, projects, and skills matter far more than the program type.

## üñ•Ô∏è Pure Computer Science Paths  

### 1. **Computer Science, B.C.Sc. Honours**  
- **Best if**: You aim for grad school, research, or you just really love taking more CS courses.  
- **Requirements**: 3.00 DGPA, minimum "B" in core COMP/MATH courses.  
- **Perks**: Priority for research assistantships, thesis option, meets requirements for competitive MSc/PhD programs.  
- **Consider**: Heavy theory focus; higher GPA requirements; comsiderable number of tough CS courses required to graduate.  

### 2. **Computer Science, B.Sc. Major**  
- **Best if**: You want a normal CS degree with industry readiness and flexibility to take interdisciplinary electives.  
- **Requirements**: 2.50 DGPA, "C+" in core courses.  
- **Perks**: Easier to combine with a minor (e.g., Business, Psychology), or accelerate via co-op.  
- **Consider**: Less preparation for graduate-level research.

## üîÄ Joint Honours: The Dual-Discipline Path  
*For students equally passionate about Computer Science and another scientific field.*  

### Joint Honours (Mathematics/Physics/Statistics)  
- **Best if**: You're deeply interested in both CS and another discipline, and aim for:  
  - Academic research or PhD programs  
  - Specialized industry roles at the intersection of fields (quant finance, scientific computing, ML research)  
- **Common Requirements**:  
  - Minimum **3.00 DGPA**  
  - Higher grades in discipline-specific courses (e.g., "A" in MATH 1700 for CS/Math)  
- **Key Advantages**:  
  - Earn credentials in two fields with one degree  
  - Stand out in niche areas where interdisciplinary knowledge is valuable  
  - Strong preparation for graduate studies in either field  
- **Key Challenges**:  
  - **Rigid structure**: Very limited elective space (30-50% less than CS Major)  
  - **Balancing act**: Requires mastery of two distinct disciplines with heavy workloads  

> *Example pathways*:  
> - CS/Mathematics ‚Üí Cryptography or Algorithmic Trading  
> - CS/Physics ‚Üí Robotics or Computational Astrophysics  
> - CS/Statistics ‚Üí Machine Learning Research

## üìä Data Science, B.Sc. Major  
### The Tri-Disciplinary Approach  
*For students equally fascinated by Computer Science, Mathematics, AND Statistics*  

- **Best if**: You want balanced training in all three pillars of data science:  
  - Computational techniques (CS)  
  - Mathematical modeling (MATH)  
  - Statistical inference (STAT)  
  ...with applications to real-world domains like health or environmental science  
- **Requirements**: 2.00 DGPA, "C+" in COMP 1020, "B" in MATH 1700  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Lower GPA barrier than CS Honours/Joint programs  
  - Integrated curriculum focused on practical data analysis  
  - Science Co-op option available  
- **Important Notes**:  
  - **Not a CS degree**: You won't have access to:  
    - Priority for CS co-op placements at tech companies  
    - CS-specific scholarships and research opportunities  
  - Only offered as a Major (no Honours pathway)  
  - Curriculum is distinct - don't treat it as a "CS backup"

## üß≠ Decision Cheat Sheet  

| Program                          | Best For                          | Flexibility | Grad School Prep | Industry Pathways |  
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|  
| CS Honours                       | Research/Academia                 | Low         | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ‚úÖ                |  
| CS Major                         | Industry + Broad Interests        | High        | ‚ùå                | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ              |  
| Joint Honours                    | Niche Interdisciplinary Fields    | Very Low    | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ‚úÖ                |  
| Data Science Major               | Applied Data Analysis             | Medium      | ‚ùå                | ‚úÖ‚úÖ                |  

### Final Advice:  
- **Start flexible**: Begin in CS Major if uncertain - you can switch later with minimal penalty.  
- **Joint Honours reality check**: Only commit if you're prepared to sacrifice electives for depth in two fields.  
- **Data Science mindset**: Choose this only if CS, MATH, *and* STAT equally excite you - it's a distinct discipline.  
- **GPA first**: A completed CS Major beats an incomplete Honours degree every time.
