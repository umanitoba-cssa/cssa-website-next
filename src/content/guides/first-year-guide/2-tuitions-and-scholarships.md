# Tuition and Scholarships

Before embarking on your university journey, it's essential to consider the financial aspects, especially if you're an international student. While this guide doesn't delve into exhaustive details, we've compiled some key resources and information to help you get started:

* [Tuition and Fees](https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/tuition-fees/undergraduate)
* [Financial Aid and Awards](https://umanitoba.ca/financial-aid-and-awards)
* [Housing Options](https://umanitoba.ca/student/housing/)
* [Pay Your Tuition](https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/tuition-fees/payment)

## Quick Overview

* **Meal Plans**: The all-you-can-eat meal plans offered by the University's residences are convenient but can be quite costly. If you're able to cook, do groceries, and share rent, you can significantly reduce living costs to below \$1,000 per month.

* **Tuition Fees**: Tuition at the University of Manitoba operates on a per-credit-hour basis. Each degree in Computer Science requires a total of 120 credits. The general expectation is to complete 24-30 credits per year to graduate in 4-5 years. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the tuition rates are:

  * **Domestic Students**: \$169.66 per credit hour, totaling approximately \$4,071.84 - \$5,089.80 per year.
  * **International Students**: \$660.99 per credit hour, totaling approximately \$15,863.76 - \$19,829.70 per year.

> Additionally, there may be other fees amounting to up to \$1,000 per year. Note that these figures do not account for co-op work terms, which can provide financial relief.

* **Scholarships & Bursaries**: The University of Manitoba issues over **$40 million annually** in scholarships and bursaries. Entrance scholarships ranging from \$1500 - \$3000 depend on your application's high school GPA, and there are yearly scholarships of value \$750 - \$1500 if you maintain a high GPA. You may also qualify for termly bursaries, dependent on your financial situation. There are also some significantly more competitive and valuable scholarships; read the Financial Aid and Awards page for more details!

* **Co-op Program**: The University of Manitoba offers a [co-op program](https://umanitoba.ca/science/programs-of-study/co-op) where you can gain practical and paid work experience for a minimum of three 4-month terms. While these terms don't count towards your credit hours, you do get paid an average of \$23 per hour, working up to 35-40 hours per week, all without needing to pay tuition during this period. This opportunity can substantially help with budgeting.
> In the co-op program you are still required to pay the co-op work term fee. This is currently $585.93 for each 4-month co-op work term

* **Undergraduate Research Awards**: The University offers Undergraduate Research Awards ([two](https://umanitoba.ca/research/opportunities-support/undergraduate-research-awards), [actually](https://umanitoba.ca/science/research/undergraduate-research/usra)) that provide \$7,000 - \$8,570 for a full-time research term in the summer. These awards are available to students who have completed a minimum of 24 credit hours of undergraduate courses and are enrolled full-time with high academic standing. However, they're quite competitive!

* **Part-time Jobs**: In addition to scholarships and co-op opportunities, you can always find a part-time job to supplement your income. The University of Manitoba's [Career Services](https://umanitoba.ca/career-services/) can assist you in applying for jobs, becoming job-ready and finding employment opportunities that fit your schedule. Later on, you can also [apply](https://viprecprod.ad.umanitoba.ca/default) as Teaching Assistants or Graders to courses you've already taken; be active and enthusiastic in your classroom and you may be taken very far!
