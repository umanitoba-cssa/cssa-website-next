# Is Computer Science for Me?

So, you're considering Computer Science. Maybe you're intrigued by the idea of building apps or games. Perhaps someone suggested it because you're good with logic or math. Or maybe you're just trying to figure out what to do with your life. Whatever the reason, you're not alone in this.

At the University of Manitoba, Computer Science is one of the most popular programs. As of [November 1, 2023](https://umanitoba.ca/institutional-analysis/sites/institutional-analysis/files/2025-02/enrol_ug_area_of_study_full_part_f23.pdf), over 1,000 students are enrolled, making it the most sought-after field of study at the university. But popularity doesn't necessarily mean it's the right fit for everyone.

## The Core Question

If you're wondering whether Computer Science is for you, start with this simple question:

***Am I curious?***

Do you find yourself asking how things work? Do you enjoy solving puzzles or figuring out how to make things better? If you answered yes, you're already thinking like a computer scientist.

Computer Science isn't just about writing code. It's about problem-solving, creativity, and making a tangible impact. Whether it's developing a mobile app, designing a website, or building a game, Computer Science empowers you to bring your ideas to life.

## Reality Check

It's important to acknowledge that the path to becoming a computer scientist isn't always smooth. The program can be challenging, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed at times. But remember, you're not in this alone. There are resources available to help you succeed, from tutoring services to study groups and faculty office hours.

The mathematical requirements may seem a bit intimidating. However, remember that the art of math also revolves around problem-solving: instead of working with programs, you’re just working with numbers! Furthermore, the only math courses you need to take will all be in your first year. While many courses require a solid mathematical base like analysis of algorithms, graphics, and machine learning, there are many others that do not: you’re free to customize your degree with courses you are interested in.

Before entering the University of Manitoba, you may have also heard of the "waitlist epidemic": that there are too many people trying to study Computer Science and not enough course sections to accommodate them. That is, unfortunately, a reality; there's no guarantee you successfully register for all the courses you need. However, the Department of Computer Science has grown significantly in the last 2 years compared to COVID, when Computer Science enrollment was at its peak, and they're opening up more and more sections to combat this issue. Fun fact: the number of sections of COMP 1020 determine how many new Computer Science students the Department is willing to take in that year! Regardless, if you want to maximize your chances, maintaining a decent GPA is very important; we discuss how to register for courses and succeed in the program in later sections.

Lastly, it goes without mentioning CS degrees *do* lead to really good job prospects. While the market has become a little oversaturated, as long as you put effort into your studies and show true passion in the subject you’ll become a very good competitor (the more reason to get involved!) University isn’t an easy gateway to a job, it’s for those who are dedicated to a discipline and want to learn. Don’t start your Computer Science journey only thinking about making six-figures or you’ll be in for a rude awakening!

## A Practical Introduction

If you're still unsure, consider exploring introductory courses or online resources to get a feel for the field. [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) provides a repository that links to a *full* Computer Science curriculum, using online courses collected from Harvard, MIT, and more! [MIT's *Introduction To CS And Programming Using Python*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/pages/material-by-lecture/) is a good, dense introduction for anyone who's getting started. Alternatively, if you don't just want to prepare for the same thing you'll be studying in first year and want to explore beyond the horizons of fundamentals early (which we highly encourage!), consider learning [web development](https://www.theodinproject.com/), [game development](https://learn.unity.com/), [machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), [cybersecurity](https://pwn.college/), and more! Lastly, [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) contains a tons of roadmaps for every field you could possibly imagine; if you know what you're already interested in, there's no reason not to start early!

Remember, the journey in Computer Science is unique for everyone. Whether you're aiming for a career in tech or seeking to enhance your problem-solving skills, the possibilities are endless. If we've convinced you to choose Computer Science with the University of Manitoba, we hope the rest of the guide can help you settle into your first year!
