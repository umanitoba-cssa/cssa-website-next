# Research Awards

Getting involved with research as an undergraduate can help you implement your knowledge from courses in real life. It is common for a lot of students to not realize that they want to get into research until they actually do a research project in their final year.

Fortunately, University of Manitoba is the first Canadian university to offer undergraduate research awards open to undergraduate students in all fields and ranges of research, scholarly works, or creative activities. With a variety of awards available, students can start applying as early as after completing their first semester at the university.
