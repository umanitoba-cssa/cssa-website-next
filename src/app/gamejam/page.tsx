                <p>Please register by joining our <a className="underline" href="https://discord.umanitobacssa.ca/gamejam">discord</a> and following the instructions in <i>#welcome</i> <br />
                    <br />
                    Teams are recommended to be a team of 4 participants (not everyone needs to be a coder). 6 team members maximum. All users should register on the discord. Only <b>ONE</b> user needs to submit their project to this page. You may also register solo.<br />
                    <br />
                    We are providing a Git repo for all teams that want it (it will be created automatically) and are recommending that groups use it, but it is not required.
                    To ensure that you are all set up for the jam we recommend that you have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <a className="underline" href="https://itch.io">Itch.io</a> account if you are leading a team</li>
                    <li>- <a className="underline" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account for code management.</li>
                    <li>- <a className="underline" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> installed.</li>
                    <li>- <a className="underline" href="https://cli.github.com">GitHub CLI</a> installed (unless you are comfortable with Git and SSH key based authentication for pulling/pushing to GitHub).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you do not have a team, you can look for a team in the <i>#looking-for-a-team</i> channel in the server to find a team.</p>
