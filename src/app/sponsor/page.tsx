                        <p>
                            Our events draw a diverse audience of potential customers, partners, and employees who
                            are interested in pursuing a career in computer science. By sponsoring our events, your
                            company can showcase its brand, products, and services to interested parties. You can
                            also demonstrate your commitment to fostering a culture of innovation, learning, and
                            community by helping us bring students these opportunities to develop their technical
                            skills and connect with one another. You can help build the next generation of the
                            computer science workforce by inspiring and empowering students to pursue their
                            curiosity for computer science, further helping them discover or cultivate their
                            passions in the field.
