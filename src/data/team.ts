            In the past I've been the Director of Technology and Promotions with the CSSA. \

            Fe things I enjoy are building things or planning to make stuff I never end up making; either that or gaming then YouTube/movies, last movie I enjoyed K-pop demon hunters. \

            It started as a way for me to play video games but then the internet happened, and along with raging over Rocket League, I dove deep into the rabbit hole of how the internet works. \
            Now, I dream of a future where I get paid to stare at a screen all day. \
            \n\nWhen I'm not fighting for my life in academia, I'm all about soccer. \
            I'm always down to play, watch or host soccer games. \
            And in case it's relevant to you, I'm a huge Real Madrid fan and I wholeheartedly pledge my allegiance to the greatest of all time, Cristiano Ronaldo.",

            After being on the advocacy committee for the past two years I found that the change made in the department has been inadequate, so I thought I would try my hand at being the CSSA Director of Advocacy! \
            When I am not trying to still comprehend how pointers in C work, you can find me at the gym, online shopping, learning new languages, doing anything music related, or watching videos on YouTube about the most random topics ever. \
            \n\nI hope to turn the department into a more welcoming space for all, whether it be the in the lounge, in classroom spaces, or on online spaces such as the Discord server. \
            Advocacy has always been important to me. \
            I'm so excited to meet everybody this upcoming year and make our department more welcoming, inclusive, and united. \
            Feel free to shoot me a message at any time if you have got any feedback or ideas, because advocacy is never a one-person job!",

            I'm really happy to be a part of the CSSA team this year<3 Ever since my first year, student clubs like WICS & CSSA have been my go-to in terms of finding an amazing group of people to be with and learn things with. \
            I'm so glad to have the opportunity to keep on going! Outside of university, I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, playing games, and listening to music. \
            I listen to pretty much every main pop girly and indie music🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ As for games, I play a few, but right now they're mainly Immortals Fenyx Rising and Mobile Legends <33 Anyway, if you see me out there, feel free to say hi!! \
            I love talking to people, especially asking questions. \
            My mom even says I should be an interviewer or an interrogator, but I fear I'm 4 years too deep to switch careers (jkjk I love CS)."

            I spend most of my time writing and drawing outside of CS, usually pursuing projects with extensive lore and world-building. \
            I also really like horror games, especially the more unconventional ones. \
            In fact, I generally like playing small weird video games that play with the medium. \
            I also really like cooking and baking various things! \

            At the University of Manitoba, students studying CS have a lot of opportunities to learn and grow outside of the classroom and I hope the CSSA can make a big impact in that area this year. \
