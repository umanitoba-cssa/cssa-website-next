        thoroughly enjoyed taking photos during events and creating social media post designs. This experience has \
        taught me what needs to be improved on for this year, so stay tuned to our socials for that! \
        Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, listening to music, playing games and sports with friends, \
        and cooking. I also love going out to get food or matcha with friends! As for games, I'm a big fan of the \
